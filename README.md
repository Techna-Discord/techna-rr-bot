# Reaction Roles, by Techna
Reaction Roles is an easily configurable bot for [Discord](https://discord.com) that allows server owners and admins to setup reaction role embeds + reactions subsequently, very efficiently and easily. The way it is setup, it is easily configurable, and can even configured quite easily to be added to your own custom/personal bot. See the links below to be directed to the setup and configuration steps for the bot.
